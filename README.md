# Hanan SAT Helper

Hanan, you better study this time.

This is an **SAT Helper App** developed for Hanan. Since she is already good with Math, this is meant to help Hanan with her vocabulary, (As I was working with the app, I noticed that I might need this as much as Hanan does, I have never heard some of these words before.) There are more than 265 words (266 to be exact), and I assume you can memorize at least 75% of them.

## 42

This is an Android App developed using Kotlin and Android Studio to help Hanan with her SATs. It uses Android Rooms, Navigation Component, Animations, and many more. 

*I made this to make Hanan study, but you can fork this to make “your Hanan” study.
P.S Original Hanan’s Helper*
